# Better Than Pebble

What your first 10 minutes of Minecraft is? Punch a tree, get some wood, make a crafting table, make some tools, and
start mining, isn't it? **— So Predictable and Boring**

What you would do if wooden tools are **no longer craftable?** What about you cannot get wood **with you bare hand?** —
This mod challenges you to be resourceful and rethink about the starting progression of Minecraft.

## Features

- Wooden tools are _uncraftable_.
- Punching wood will take more time and yield 0–4 sticks instead of wood.
- Sand, Gravel, Scorched Dirt, Rich Scorched Dirt, Scorched Grass, Dirt, Retro Grass, and Grass will have _small
  chances_ to drop some pebbles.
- New item: Rock
    - Can be used to get wood and mine stone.
    - Has slightly more damage than bare hand.
- New crafting recipes:
    - 4 pebbles (2x2) = 1 rock
    - 4 rocks (2x2) = 1 cobblestone

> Existing wooden tools will not be removed
