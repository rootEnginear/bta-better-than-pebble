# Better Than Pebble

This mod challenges you to rethink about the starting progression of Minecraft. What you would do if wooden tools are
**no longer craftable?** What about you cannot get wood **with you bare hand?**

## Features

- Wooden tools are _uncraftable_.
- Punching wood will take more time and yield 0–4 sticks instead of wood.
- Sand, Gravel, Scorched Dirt, Rich Scorched Dirt, Scorched Grass, Dirt, Retro Grass, and Grass will have _small
  chances_ to drop some pebbles.
- New item: **Rock**
    - Better than pebble.
    - Can be used to get wood and mine stone.
    - Has slightly more damage than bare hand.
- New crafting recipes:
    - 4 pebbles (2x2) = 1 rock
    - 4 rocks (2x2) = 1 cobblestone

> Existing wooden tools will not be removed
