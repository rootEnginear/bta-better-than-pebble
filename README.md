# Better Than Pebble

Introducing the wooden tool alternative and reimagining the starting progression of Minecraft. What would you do if
wooden tools were **no longer craftable?** How about you **cannot get wood with your bare hand?**

## Features

- Wooden tools are _uncraftable_.
- Punching wood will take more time and yield 0–4 sticks instead of wood.
- Sand, Gravel, Scorched Dirt, Rich Scorched Dirt, Scorched Grass, Dirt, Retro Grass, and Grass will have _small
  chances_ to drop some pebbles.
- New item: **Rock**
    - Better than pebble.
    - Can be used to get wood and mine stone.
    - Has slightly more damage than bare hand.
- New crafting recipes:
    - 4 pebbles (2x2) = 1 rock
    - 4 rocks (2x2) = 1 cobblestone

> Existing wooden tools will not be removed
